1.
/^The\b/
Note: /\AThe\b/ does not work; \A matches the beginning of the str only (only finds the 1st occurence of 'The')

2.
/\bcat$/

3.
/\b[a-z][a-z][a-z]\b/i
or
/\b[a-z]{3}\b/i

4.
/^(A|The) [a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z] (dog|cat)$/i
or
/^(A|The) [a-z]{4} (dog|cat)$/i

can't use
/^(A|The) \w\w\w\w (dog|cat)$/i
because they asked for a 4-letter (and not a 4-char) word
