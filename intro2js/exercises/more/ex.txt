1.
- logs [1, 4, 3]
- assignment of an arr elem mutates the arr; array2 still pts to that same Array obj

2.
- 'greeting' is not def'd
- there is an err in exercise2.js at line 4, char 15, in the 'hello' fn
- the err is w/i an anonymous fn def; the fn is called at line 13, char 1

3.
console.log(Math.sqrt(37));

5.
function doSomething(string) {
  return string.split(' ').reverse().map((value) => value.length);
}

- the fn takes a str as an arg
- it then
  - splits the str into an arr of 'words' (splits on a space char)
  - reverses the arr
  - creates a new arr, replacing each word by the num of chars in the word (the word 'length')
  - returns the new arr of word lengths

7.
- exeception handling is the handling of errs in a program which would otherwise cause the prog exec to halt
- errs are handled by code to trap a potential err, print or log a msg, and allow exec to continue

from the solution:
- a process that deals with errs in a manageable and predictable manner
- in JS, it uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions raised by code in the try block
