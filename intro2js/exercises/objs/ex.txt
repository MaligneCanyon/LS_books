1.
person.name
OR
person['name']

2.
JS coerces non-str keys to strs (if possible), so these are all valid keys
    1
    '1'
    undefined
    'hello world'
    true
    'true'

8.
console.log(foo.a); //-> 'hi'; foo.a is re-assigned in bar, mutating foo
console.log(qux); //-> 'hello'; bar doesn't rtn anything, and the value of qux is unchanged by bar (argument2 is just a local var w/i bar, and Strings are immutable anyway)
